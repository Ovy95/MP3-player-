# Golang Learning
Golang in London - Meetup <br>
This is a project built at a meetup using Golang. It's plays a mp3 file. The file has comments on the code to give a better understanding of what it does.
<br>
Just need to add a Mp3 file to the folder to play, and call it in the method.

### Future features that could be added
* Speed up/ slow down the song 
* Playing more then one song 
* Skipping songs
